◊p{TPMs (Trusted Platform Modules) are maddening to work with; the
documentation and source code are terrible, and companies that have
done TPM stuff don't talk about it. There is next-to-no documentation
for what's expected in many cases, and a lot of times I worked out how
to proceed using trial-and-error. I set out to integrate TPMs into our
systems, armed with only a copy of
◊link["www.amazon.com/dp/0132398427/"]{A Practical Guide to Trusted Computing},
 the ◊link["http://trousers.sourceforge.net/"]{Trousers} source code,
and ◊link["http://cscope.sourceforge.net/"]{cscope}, and slowly began
to work out how to use them. In this series, I'd like to share what
I've learned in the hopes that you, too, don't pull out all your
hair.}

  ◊li{◊link["introduction.html"]{Introduction to TPMs}: what are they
  and what are they good for? Our tale begins, as most do, with some
  expository background to set the stage.}
