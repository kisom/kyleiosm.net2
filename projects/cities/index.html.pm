◊h2{Cities and Complexity}

◊p{◊link["http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262524791/"]{Cities and Complexity} has
been a refreshing read so far. It steps outside of the subjects I
normally read; I don't really remember what led me to pick it
up. While reading through it, I've been implementing some of the
models (in Processing), which has been a lot of fun (albeit a tad
frustrating given the limits of the Processing environment).}

◊p{Here, I'll be putting up some of the results of the models I've
built. There's a certain joy to watching the grid self-organise based
on simple rules.}

  ◊li{The first, and most basic model, is the
  ◊link["diffcon/"]{◊strong{diffusion-contact}} model. It supposed
  a simple clustering, in which agents will settle and start
  developing an area when they reach a certain threshold of
  neighbours.}
