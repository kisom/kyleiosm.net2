◊h2{The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect}

◊p{
◊link["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13095728-the-metamorphosis-of-prime-intellect"]{The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect}
was a thought-provoking read. Many will find the book's content
offensive, as it deals with subjects such as sadomasochism and incest;
indeed, some parts were uncomfortable to read. I suppose it's in the
discomfort that one finds something worth thinking about, though.}

◊p{The story revolves around the world made perfect (◊|oq|The
Change◊|cq|) and the reverting of this heaven, performed by an
omnipotent artificial intelligence termed ◊em{Prime Intellect} (being
the most powerful of a sequence of ◊em{Intellect} software programs,
developed on revolutionary hardware). This program has been imbued
with a version of ◊q{Asimov's} Three Laws:}

◊ol{

  ◊li{Prime Intellect may not injure a human being or, through
  inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.}

  ◊li{Prime Intellect must obey the orders given to it by human
  beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.}

  ◊li{Prime Intellect must protect its own existence as long as such
  protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.}
}

◊p{Being as it is omnipotent, and to some extent omniscient, Prime
Intellect comes to understand that in order to satisfy the first law,
it must prevent all suicides and murders, and does so by restructuring
reality (through some glossed-over quantum ◊em{magic}, for lack of a
better term). This is, of course, an unforseen effect by the ◊q{program's}
creator.}

◊p{◊q{It's} interesting to consider here that omnipotence and omniscience
fail to consider the need for ◊strong{omnisophia}◊|md|the wisdom to
properly apply the knowledge and power it has. As Lawrence, the
◊q{program's} creator, muses in the book:}

◊blockquote{◊|oq|Prime Intellect was an uncertain god. It had acted
because it had to, but if it had been human its hand would be shaking
on the controls.◊|cq|}

◊p{The uncertainty of Prime Intellect leads to several moral
conundrums; particularly noted in the book is that of the Death
Contracts.}

◊p{As part of its requirement to fulfill the first law, any time a
human was about to die (whether naturally, by the hand of another, or
by their own hand), Prime Intellect was compelled to
intervene◊|md|by altering reality, as it were, or to restore them
from ◊|oq|backup◊|cq|. Several groups of people, bored of the Garden of
Eden-style existence, chose to enter Death Contracts: by ordering
Prime Intellect not to intervene until they actually died, even if
they asked it to. This contract (which Prime Intellect, after an event
in which a person was driven insane, instituted a twenty-four hour
time limit on) in place, these people would attempt to find creative
ways in which to kill themselves, to make the pain last as long and as
intensely as possible. In a world where every pleasure was available,
where existence and accomplishment no longer had any meaning, this was
how they sought out meaning and humanity.}

◊p{The book explores the quandary of Prime ◊q{Intellect's} requirement to
fulfill the second law, which compels it to honour the Death
Contracts, with its requirement to honour the first law. Prime
◊q{Intellect's} enforcement of these laws does not permit human will to
come into play: a person who wishes to die can no more actually die
than to accidentally die.}

◊p{The difficult subject material ◊q{isn't} for everyone, but I enjoyed
the ◊q{book's} consideration of the implications of the Garden of Eden in
the light of humanity.}
