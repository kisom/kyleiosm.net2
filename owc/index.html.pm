◊h2{Reading List}
◊h3['style: "text-align: center;"]{Selections from the Oxford World's Classics}

◊p{As two of my interests are history and literature, and having
recently discovered the
◊link["http://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-worlds-classics-owc/"]{Oxford World's Classics collection},
I've set about trying to read through some of these books. There's
quite a few I've read before but would love to read again, and even
more I've never read. The first batch of six books showed up. I
started with Virgil's ◊em{◊|AE|neid}, and tentatively I'll be reading
the following books in order:}

◊ol{

  ◊li{Stephanie Dalley's ◊em{Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, the
  Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others}.}

  ◊li{Herodotus ◊em{The Histories}, which is a favourite of mine and I
  look forward to reading a new translation.}

  ◊li{Geoffrey Chaucer's ◊em{The Canterbury Tales}; I was first
  exposed to this in high school, and, courtesy of an excellent
  English teacher, think this may have been the book to instill a deep
  interest in classic literature.}

  ◊li{Ovid's ◊em{Metamorphoses}.}

  ◊li{Percey Shelley's ◊em{The Major Works}; his poem
  ◊|oq|Ozymandias◊|cq| is one of my favourite poems.}

}

◊p{Together, these books are roughly four thousand pages (not
including explanatory notes), so this is as far as my planning goes
for now◊|md|first goal is to make time to read these, then see what
strikes my fancy afterwards. I've been toying with the idea of a bot
that picks a random book, purchases it, and sends it to me at a
semi-random interval based on how long it takes me to get through
them, which may be more interesting than curating a path myself.}

◊p{As I (hopefully) finish books, I'll keep a tally here. Ideally,
I'll also write up an essay on each book.}

◊h3{Progress}

◊ul{

  ◊li{◊em{◊|AE|neid}: starting Book Two (page 28/327)}
